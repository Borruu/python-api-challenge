# python-api-challenge
1. Run WeatherPy.ipynb to collect and store weather data from approximately 550-650 cities around the world using randomly generated coordinates. API keys will be required for Geoapify and OpenWeather App.
2. Graphs created by WeatherPy.ipynb will be stored in output_data.
3. VacationPy.ipynb can be run after WeatherPy.ipynb as it is dependent on the data collected by latter.
